		<h2>Diversity</h2>
		<p>Diversity is a new hot topic. In all branches of social life, we’re seeing sentiments expressing a desire for more diversity. Calls for fighting for a more inclusive, diverse society happen regularly. And rightly so, because we’re living in a society in which people are disadvantaged and excluded. This happens on an individual basis, on a group level, as well as structurally. No matter how confronting, it’s an undeniable fact, for which countless news articles, social media messages, personal stories, and studies can be provided. Diversity needs our attention.</p>
		<h2>Teenage</h2>
		<p>One of the most difficult and complicated parts of a person’s life is their teenage years. Many decisions by teenagers make direct and influential impacts their future, particularly towards their future college, job, and level of success. While going through massive bodily changes, a teenager has to deal with school work, sustaining a social life, and making time for extracurricular activities, all while making some of the most important choices of their lives. With so many different expectations to meet both socially and academically, being a teenager is no walk in the park.</p>
		<p>The most common choices that lead to the ruining of a teen’s future are alcohol and illegal drug usage. Use of alcohol, not on a daily basis, is often a choice made by a teen facing peer pressure. Teens are often desperate to make friends or even just acquaintances, and unfortunately will often go the extent of drinking to make friends. However, if a teenager is caught drinking illegally, whatever value they got socially will backfire in massive and unrecoverable ways. A teen’s chances of achieving whatever goal they held for their future is almost always plummeted to rounding error of 0% if they are caught drinking. Another common choice that leads to the destruction of a teen’s dreams is illegal drug usage. Illegal drug usage by teenagers can stem from peer pressure, but is just as often caused by a teenager’s wish to rebel against his parents. The damage caused by illegal drug usage makes the damage of illegal drinking seem like child’s play. Illegal drug use by teens, if caught, can bring rejection from almost any college, often leads to expulsion from high school, goes on the teen’s permanent record, and leads to rejections from majority of occupations and jobs.</p>
